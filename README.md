# SQL


## Overview of Project

This project scenario involves employee research and analysis for a large company with several thousand employees. As baby boomers continue to retire at increasing rates, the company is offering retirement packages to those who meet certain criteria and is looking to fill positions that will be vacated in the near future as a result. For the employee analysis the followsing needs to be determined:

* Who will be retiring in the next few years?
* How many positions will need to be filled?

As the pre-existing company data is only available in a number of .csv files, the goal is to to build a more suitable employee database with SQL. Answering these questions through the analysis will help the company plan for future staffing needs.
